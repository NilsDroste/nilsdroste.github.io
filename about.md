I am Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) in Environmental Politics at the [Political Science Department](https://www.svet.lu.se/en/start-department-of-political-science) and the strategic research area [Biodiversity and Ecosystems in a Changing Climate](https://www.becc.lu.se/) where I am principal investigator and deputy theme leader of the biodiversity theme.

I want to understand how environmental policies can help societies transition towards a sustainable land use. In particular I am insterested in how different institutions mediate the relation between humans and the natural environment - be those cultural, markets, or state regulation. In my view we need to understand both the functioning of ecosystems as well as the societal processes when analyzing the role and functioning of these mediating institutions. Forest provide a particularly interesting case to study these, given their multifunctionality and the multitude of interests in them.

As a Post-Doc at the [Center for Environmental and Climate Research](https://www.cec.lu.se/) (CEC), Lund University, I worked on insurance values of soil biodiversity.

For my doctoral thesis at the [Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research -- UFZ](https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=34253), I conducted econometric analyses to infer effects of ecological fiscal transfers on protected area development in Brazil and Portugal. From these empirical studies I have developed policy advice, e.g. for an ecological public finance design of EU and global funds. I hold a Master in Sustainability Economics (Carl von Ossietzky University Oldenburg) and a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science (Uni Bremen).

<!-- The theoretical foundation for these analyses is the principle of fiscal equivalence by Mancur Olson ([1969](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1823700)). It states that those jurisdictions who benefit from a policy should also bear the corresponding costs of provision. It is thus based on ideas of economic efficiency but outcomes can also be analyzed in terms of equity (cf. [Ostrom, 2011, p. 16](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-0072.2010.00394.x/full)). Depending on the characteristics of the good in question, the degree of optimal<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> (and / or equitable) decentralization of legislative competencies may vary (cf. [Tiebout, 1956; ](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1826343)[Qian and Weingast, 1997; ](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2138464)[Faguet, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X13000089)). Structure-wise, such overlapping competencies regarding (natural) resource usage are often organized within polycentric, multiorder governance systems ([Eusepi and Wagner, 2010; ](https://www.degruyter.com/abstract/j/rle.2010.6.3/rle.2010.6.3.1534/rle.2010.6.3.1534.xml)[Ostrom, 2010](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27871226)). In this context I am analyzing effects of fiscal transfer and competency changes. -->

<!-- Generally, I am interested in how econometric methods can be used in order to assess effects of both existing and proposed policy changes. -->

<!-- Currently, I am extending the original topic of my PhD in terms of field work regarding the decentral and participatory organization of public finances and conservation competencies in Ecuador. -->
