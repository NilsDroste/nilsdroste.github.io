  I am a PhD student interested in applied econometric research on public finance institutions for conservation and participatory governance mechanisms for sustainable development and public good provision.
</p>

For my thesis, I apply econometric analyses to infer effects of ecological fiscal transfers on protected area development in Brazil and Portugal. From these empirical studies I am developing policy advice, e.g. for an ecological public finance design of EU funds.

The theoretical foundation for these analyses is the principle of fiscal equivalence by Mancur Olson ([1969](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1823700)). It states that those jurisdictions who benefit from a policy should also bear the corresponding costs of provision. It is thus based on ideas of economic efficiency but can also be analyzed in terms of equity (cf. [Ostrom, 2011, p. 16](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-0072.2010.00394.x/full)). Depending on the characteristics of the good in question, the degree of optimal<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> (and / or equitable) decentralization of legislative competencies may vary (cf. [Tiebout, 1956; ](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1826343)[Qian and Weingast, 1997; ](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2138464)[Faguet, 2014](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X13000089)). Structure-wise, such overlapping competencies regarding (natural) resource usage are often organized within polycentric, multiorder governance systems ([Eusepi and Wagner, 2010; ](https://www.degruyter.com/abstract/j/rle.2010.6.3/rle.2010.6.3.1534/rle.2010.6.3.1534.xml)[Ostrom, 2010](http://www.jstor.org/stable/27871226)). In this context I am analyzing effects of fiscal transfer and competency changes.

Empirically, I employ micro-econometric techniques such as:
- panel data analysis for a non-simultaneous self-selection into treatment of implementing ecological fiscal transfers in Brazil;
- Bayesian structural time series analysis, simulating a counterfactual time series for fiscal transfers policy changes in Portugal; or
- decision trees and random forest models for obtaining characteristics of potential beneficiaries of a EU wide ecological allocative mechanism of EU funds.

For current versions of the respective papers see <a href="http://nils.droste.io/01_publications/">publications</a>. Generally, I am interested in how econometric methods can be used in order to assess effects of both existing and proposed policy changes.

<!---I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science (Uni Bremen) and Master in Sustainability Economics (CarQl von Ossietzky University Oldenburg). For my PhD I am at the Martin-Luther University Halle-Wittenberg and the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research - UFZ (where I have conducted most of my research). Currently I am with the Faculty of Social Sciences (FLACSO) Ecuador.--->

Currently, I am extending the original topic of my PhD in terms of field work regarding the decentral and participatory organization of public finances and conservation competencies in Ecuador.
