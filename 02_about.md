I am a Post-Doc at the Center for Environmental and Climate Research (CEC), Lund University, currently working on insurance values of soil biodiversity.

For my doctoral thesis at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research -- UFZ, I have conducted econometric analyses to infer effects of ecological fiscal transfers on protected area development in Brazil and Portugal. From these empirical studies I have developed policy advice, e.g. for an ecological public finance design of EU funds. I hold a Master in Sustainability Economics (Carl von Ossietzky University Oldenburg) and a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science (Uni Bremen).

<!-- The theoretical foundation for these analyses is the principle of fiscal equivalence by Mancur Olson ([1969](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1823700)). It states that those jurisdictions who benefit from a policy should also bear the corresponding costs of provision. It is thus based on ideas of economic efficiency but outcomes can also be analyzed in terms of equity (cf. [Ostrom, 2011, p. 16](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-0072.2010.00394.x/full)). Depending on the characteristics of the good in question, the degree of optimal<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> (and / or equitable) decentralization of legislative competencies may vary (cf. [Tiebout, 1956; ](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1826343)[Qian and Weingast, 1997; ](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2138464)[Faguet, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X13000089)). Structure-wise, such overlapping competencies regarding (natural) resource usage are often organized within polycentric, multiorder governance systems ([Eusepi and Wagner, 2010; ](https://www.degruyter.com/abstract/j/rle.2010.6.3/rle.2010.6.3.1534/rle.2010.6.3.1534.xml)[Ostrom, 2010](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27871226)). In this context I am analyzing effects of fiscal transfer and competency changes. -->

Generally, I am interested in applied econometric research on public finance institutions for land use, conservation, and participatory governance mechanisms for sustainable development and public good provision. Empirically, I employ micro-econometric techniques such as:

  - panel data analysis for a non-simultaneous self-selection into treatment of implementing ecological fiscal transfers in Brazil;
  - Bayesian structural time series analysis, simulating a counterfactual time series for fiscal transfer policy changes in Portugal; or
  - regression trees and random forest models for obtaining characteristics of potential beneficiaries of a EU wide ecological allocative mechanism of EU funds;

and recently, I have started some content-analysis of research topics through unsupervised machine learning based algorithms. For current versions of the respective papers see <a href="https://nils.droste.io/01_publications/">publications</a>.

<!-- Generally, I am interested in how econometric methods can be used in order to assess effects of both existing and proposed policy changes. -->

<!-- Currently, I am extending the original topic of my PhD in terms of field work regarding the decentral and participatory organization of public finances and conservation competencies in Ecuador. -->
