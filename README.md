The side is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://github.io), using [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) theme based on [Poole](https://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler. The contact and information icons are based on [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.io/) and [Academicons](https://github.com/jpswalsh/academicons). I was inspired and employed ideas on page design from [Jonathan Bechtel](https://patricksteadman.ca/2014/08/04/lanyonsetup/) and [Patrick Steadman](https://patricksteadman.ca/2014/08/04/lanyonsetup/). Thanks guys!
