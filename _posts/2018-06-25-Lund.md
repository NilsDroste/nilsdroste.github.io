title: My next step - CEC @ Lund University
---

I have just accepted a post-doc position at the Center for Environmental and Climate Research ([CEC](https://www.cec.lu.se/about-cec)) in Lund, within the strategic research area Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services in a Changing Climate ([BECC](http://www.becc.lu.se)). I am going to work with [Mark Brady](http://www.agrifood.se/engstaffDetail.aspx?fKeyID=3), [Katarina Hedlund](https://www.biology.lu.se/katarina-hedlund), [Yann Clough](http://yannclough.weebly.com/), [Wilhelm May](https://www.cec.lu.se/wilhelm-may), [Luca Di Corato](https://sites.google.com/site/ekonluca/), and [Yves Surry](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yves_Surry) on the insurance value of soil biodiversity with regard to increasing weather variability. The project is called, ”Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services as Insurance against risks of Future Weather Variability ([BioInsure](http://www.agrifood.se/engproject.aspx?fKeyID=175))”. I will be starting in September.

I am super excited!
