title: My next step - Centre for Environmental and Climate Research, Lund University
---

I have just accepted a post-doc position with [CEC](https://www.cec.lu.se/about-cec) in Lund within the strategic research area Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services in a Changing Climate, [BECC](http://www.becc.lu.se). I am going to work with Mark Brady, Katharina Hedlund, Yann Clough, and Wilhelm May on the insurance value of soil biodiversity against increasing weather variability. The project is called, ”Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services as Insurance against risks of Future Weather Variability (BioInsure)”. I will be starting in September.

I am super excited!
