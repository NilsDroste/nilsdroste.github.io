I have just accepted a post-doc position with [CEC](https://www.cec.lu.se/about-cec) in Lund within the strategic research area Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services in a Changing Climate, [BECC](http://www.becc.lu.se). I am going to work with Mark Brady, Katarina Hedlund, Yann Clough, Wilhelm May, Luca Di Corato, and Yves Surry on the insurance value of soil biodiversity with regard to increasing weather variability. The project is called, ”Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services as Insurance against risks of Future Weather Variability (BioInsure)”. I will be starting in September.

I am super excited!
