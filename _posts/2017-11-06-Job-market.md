I am available for the job market 2018.

In case you are interested in the composition of my work on evidence-based policy advice regarding Ecological Fiscal Transfers, [here](http://nils.droste.io/research/thesis/Droste2017_Incentives in Ecological Fiscal Transfers.pdf) is the my dissertation to be submitted in December.

In case you are rather interested in a single job-market paper, [here](http://nils.droste.io/research/EFT-world/Droste-et-al_2017_On a global mechanism for biodiversity financing.pdf) is the crown jewel paper of my dissertation.

[Here](http://nils.droste.io/research/CV/CV2017.pdf) is my CV for download.

Below, you find kind of a graphical abstract. Take it with an imaginary teaser: suppose that some portion of fiscal transfers is dedicated to the existence of protected areas.

*Does that increase the designation of protected areas?* Check out my dissertation.

Let me know if you have any questions, requests, or offers ;).
