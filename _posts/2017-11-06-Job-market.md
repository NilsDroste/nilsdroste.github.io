I am about to submit my thesis and will be available for the job market 2018.

In case you are interested in the composition of my work on Ecological Fiscal Transfers, [here](http://nils.droste.io/research/thesis/Droste2017_Incentives in Ecological Fiscal Transfers.pdf) is the my dissertation to be submitted in December.

In case you are rather interested in a single job-market paper, [here](http://nils.droste.io/research/EFT-world/Droste-et-al_2017_On a global mechanism for biodiversity financing.pdf) is the crown jewel of my dissertation.
