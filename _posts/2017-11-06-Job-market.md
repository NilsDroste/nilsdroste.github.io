title: I am on the 2018 Job Market

In case you are interested in the composition of my work on evidence-based policy advice regarding Ecological Fiscal Transfers, [here](http://nils.droste.io/research/thesis/Droste2017_Incentives in Ecological Fiscal Transfers.pdf) is my dissertation (to be submitted in December).

In case you are rather interested in a single job-market paper, [here](http://nils.droste.io/research/EFT-world/Droste-et-al_2017_On a global mechanism for biodiversity financing_job_market_paper.pdf) is the crown jewel paper of my dissertation. It's a policy design study for a global biodiversity financing mechanism.

[Here](http://nils.droste.io/research/CV/CV2017ND.pdf) is my CV for download.

Below, you find kind of a graphical abstract. Take it with an imaginary teaser: suppose that some portion of fiscal transfers is dedicated to the existence of protected areas.
