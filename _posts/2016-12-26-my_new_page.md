  Welcome! This is my first blog post and references my sources of inspiration for the design of my page.
</div>

A personal web presence in today's connected world is at least useful. So I built my own page.

The side is hosted by [GitHub Pages](http://github.io), using [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler. The contact and information icons are based on [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) and [Academicons](https://github.com/jpswalsh/academicons). I was inspired and employed ideas on page design from [Jonathan Bechtel](http://patricksteadman.ca/2014/08/04/lanyonsetup/) and [Patrick Steadman](http://patricksteadman.ca/2014/08/04/lanyonsetup/). Thanks guys!
