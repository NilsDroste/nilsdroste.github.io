  Welcome! This is my first blog post and references my sources of inspiration for the design of my page.
</div>

A personal web presence in today's connected world is at least useful. So I built my own page.

The side is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://github.io), using [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) theme based on [Poole](https://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler. The contact and information icons are based on [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.io/) and [Academicons](https://github.com/jpswalsh/academicons). I was inspired and employed ideas on page design from [Jonathan Bechtel](https://jonathonbechtel.com/2015/11/16/building-my-first-blog-ever-using-jekyll-and-github-pages/), [Kyle Stratis](https://kylestratis.com/2015/04/17/blog-setup/), [Patrick Steadman](https://patricksteadman.ca/2014/08/04/lanyonsetup/), and of course [Joshua Lande](https://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole). Thanks guys!
