About four years into my assistant professorial position, I have recently been granted a ***venia docendi*** in the house of knowledge ;)

I am now Docent in Environmental Politics at the [Political Science Department](https://www.svet.lu.se/en/start-department-of-political-science) and [Environmental Politics Research Group](https://www.svet.lu.se/en/research/research-groups/environmental-politics-research-group-eprg); deputy theme leader in the biodiversity theme [Biodiversity and Ecosystems in a Changing Climate](https://www.becc.lu.se/). And, I am fellow at the [Centre for Innovation Research](https://www.circle.lu.se/).

Most importantly, this means I am now formally allowed to supervise PhD students as a main supervisor.

Got a couple of research projects going on: [GreenPole](https://greenpole.se) and [Mistra Biopath](https://www.mistrabiopath.se) are possibly the biggest of them.
