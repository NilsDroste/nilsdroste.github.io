  letting the data speak: Latent Dirichlet Allocation
</div>

We have analyzed topics in ecosystem service research through a fancy unsupervised machine learning algorithm developed by Blei et al. ([2003](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v3/blei03a.html)), called Latent Dirichlet Allocation, which we use to analyze how the content has developed and changed over three time periods from 1990 to 2016.

The interactive plots for the subset periods can be found here:

[1990-2000](https://nils.droste.io/research/ES_LDA/topicmodelvis_1970_2000/index.html),
[2001-2010](https://nils.droste.io/research/ES_LDA/topicmodelvis_2001_2010/index.html), and
[2011-2016](https://nils.droste.io/research/ES_LDA/topicmodelvis_2011_2016/index.html)

The visuals are based on [ldavis](https://github.com/cpsievert/LDAvis), an [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package.

To get an idea of how to interpret these plots you can check out [statgraphics'](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq6VSkbys_dJK_WlWimQaTg) video:
