As of this Monday, I will be starting as Associate Senior Lecturer (Bitr√§dande Lektor) in Environmental Politics at the [Political Science Department](https://www.svet.lu.se/en/start-department-of-political-science) in Lund. My position is co-financed by the strategic research area [Biodiversity and Ecosystems in a Changing Climate](https://www.becc.lu.se/). I will also form part of the [Environmental Politics Research Group](https://www.svet.lu.se/en/research/research-groups/environmental-politics-research-group-eprg). Method wise, I will be one of the few scholars bridging social and environmental science through quantitative methods. Teaching wise, I will be part of the teams for "International Environmental Governance" and "Methods in Social Science". This four year, tenure-track position is going to a super exiting interdisciplinary and hopefully trandisciplinary journey!

I really want to get my hands dirty with some applied and evidence-based policy advice for effective conservation policies ;)
