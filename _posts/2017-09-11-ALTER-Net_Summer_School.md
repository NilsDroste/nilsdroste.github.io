I am back from a fabulous experience in Peyresq, France, at the [ALTER-Net Summer School](www.alter-net.info/summer-school). It was an intense 10 day summerschool on biodiversity, ecosystem services, and science-policy interfaces in a gorgeous village in Alpes-de-Haute-Provence.

Five elements contributed essentially to the extraordinariness of the experience:

- [high-level speakers](#speakers)
- [amazing tutors](#tutors)
- [the well-structured and mostly self-organized group work](#groupwork)
- [my fellow peers (who are really great people!)](#peers)
and of course,
- [the village of Peyresq, and the staff](#peyresq)

## Speakers

The organizers, [Allan Watt](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/staff/allan-watt), [Martin Sherman](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sharman/) and last but not least, [Marie Vandewalle](https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=38978), did a fantastic job in inviting a stunning set of high-level speakers who amazed me with their input. We heard about a variety of ***science-policy interfaces*** on socio-ecological problems of our times: we had in-depth insights on [IPBES](https://www.ipbes.net/) (biodiversity) by [Carsten Nesshöver](https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=38955), [IPCC](https://ipcc.ch/) (climate) by [Wolfgang Cramer](https://www.imbe.fr/wolfgang-cramer?lang=en), [INI](https://initrogen.org/) (nitrogen) by [Marc Sutton](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/staff/mark-sutton), [SDGs](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) (sustainable development) by [Eeva Furman](https://www.syke.fi/en-US/Experts/Employee_profiles/Eeva_Furman(3322)), and [Experimental Ecosystem Accounting](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/eea_project/default.asp) by [Sander Jacobs](https://pureportal.inbo.be/portal/en/persons/sander-jacobs(75310055-34c2-4cc4-b26e-982351cc24b1).html).
We had talks on ***latest methodogical developments*** in participatory planning by [Francis Turkelboom](https://pureportal.inbo.be/portal/en/persons/francis-turkelboom(f2c35d02-a9f8-41a5-a85f-03944082717b).html), ES mapping by [Nicolas Dedonker](https://directory.unamur.be/staff/ndendonc), aquatic ES management by [Sonja Jähnig](https://www.igb-berlin.de/en/profile/sonja-jahnig), forest diversity by [Stephen Cavers](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/staff/stephen-cavers), ES bundling by [Emilie Crouzat](https://www-leca.ujf-grenoble.fr/pageperso/crouzate/), interactive valuation with [Marc Metzger](https://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/mmetzger), and economic valuation by [Erik Gomez-Baggethun](https://www.nmbu.no/emp/erik.gomez).
To help ***scientific self-reflection***, we heard inspiring inputs about the "post-truth" world by [Martin Sharman](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sharman/), the precautionary principle by [Sybille van den Hove](https://twitter.com/SybillevdH), ethics within ES research by [Kurt Jax](https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=38933), human-wolf relations by [Taru Peltola](https://wwwp.ymparisto.fi/scripts/hapa/h.asp?Method=PERSONFORM&txtuserid=10249&txtlang=EN&txtorgid=), and the relevance of research from a societal perspective by [Raoul Mille](https://www.irstea.fr/en/all-news/institute/raoul-mille-new-director-international-relations-irstea). With regard to the broad range of topics and compentencies, I am really grateful for having had the chance to get in touch with them.

## Tutors
[Nicolas Dedonker](https://directory.unamur.be/staff/ndendonc), [Brooke Wilkerson](https://no.linkedin.com/in/brooke-wilkerson-3379a226), [Uta Fritsch](https://www.eurac.edu/en/aboutus/organisation/servicedepartments/press/pages/staffdetails.aspx?persId=10223), [Klara Winkler](https://www.uni-oldenburg.de/en/wire/ecoeco/team/klara-winkler-m-sc/) and [Emilie Crouzat](https://www-leca.ujf-grenoble.fr/pageperso/crouzate/) did an excellent job in guiding us through the participatory group work, being both considerably respectful and insightfully nudging. You did a great job. Thank you!

## Groupwork
We were working on a project: "***H***ow to maintain w***el***lbeing and b***io***diver***s***ity in the upper Verdon Valley?" (***Helios***). Within 7 days we were to deliver an analysis of the current status quo including trends, develop scenarios, assess trade-offs and synergies, propose policy-measures and present the findings. A challenging task which - after we had settled for understanding it as a simulation without the need to do all these steps in all possible detail - became great fun! The original working group proposal looked like this:

In the end, we had developed a far more complicated, yet effective structure with further special taskforce groups on trade-offs and synergies, policy proposals, creative communication, and the scenario envisioning. We were delving into a lively and really inspiring collaborative process, that has taught me a lot on structures and collaboration.

A really helpful lesson was the technique that was employed: **[Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban)**, which allowed to transparently and flexibly schedule, prioritize, breakdown, implement and validate tasks within working groups. It is really worth being tried! It even inspired a couple of songs that were composed in our leisure time.

## Peers
Getting in touch with 34 highly skilled young scientists from not just Europe but all over the place was a great source of inspiration. Very bright minds! I am quite sure a couple of us will remain connected and strive together towards solving the world's socio-ecological crises! I am deeply grateful for you partaking in this experience. Imagine all us people, working for the world (sorry, this is an insider)!

## Peyresq

A beautiful, refurbished historical mountain village, remote, without high-speed internet, named after the French humanist [Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas-Claude_Fabri_de_Peiresc) and one of the best places I have been so far. The staff was very friendly and the food was delicious. Perfect for hosting the summer school!

***For me this was a 100 per cent recommendable experience. If you ever have the chance to attend -- do it!***
